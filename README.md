# Filpster-Crypto

This is a sample of socket-base apllication using #'WebSocket Stream' for live interaction with server.
WebSockets are the standard network protocol for event-driven based applications in order that you can emmit messages and always be ready to listen to provide a persistent communication channel between clients and a server.
This project is developed based on clean architecture using #'SwiftUI' framework and #'AsyncSequence' that is a Swift in-built mechanism leveraging concurrency features over connecting WebSocket.
