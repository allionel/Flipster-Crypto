This is a sample of **`socket-base`** apllication using **`WebSocket Stream`** for live interaction with server.


WebSockets are the standard network protocol for event-driven based applications in order that you can emmit messages and always be ready to listen and in the way you can provide a persistent communication channel between clients and a server.


This project is developed based on `Clean` Architecture using **`SwiftUI`** framework and **`AsyncSequence`** that is a Swift in-built mechanism leveraging concurrency features over connecting WebSocket.
